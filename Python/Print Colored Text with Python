#Print Colored Text with Python
'''Using the Colorama module we can print colored text with Python. We can use it and call its built-in variables which are aliases for the desired ANSI codes. This makes our code more readable and works better with Windows command prompts after calling colorama.init() at the start of your script.'''
import colorama
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style
colorama.init(autoreset=True)

print(Fore.BLUE+Back.YELLOW+"Hi My name is Khushi Mehta "+ Fore.YELLOW+ Back.BLUE+"I am your Machine Learning Instructor")
print(Back.CYAN+"Hi My name is Khushi Mehta")
print(Fore.RED + Back.GREEN+ "Hi My name is Khushi Mehta")
